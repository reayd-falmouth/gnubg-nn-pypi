GNUBG NeuralNet Python bindings bring the powerful GNUBG backgammon neural-network engine to Python 3.

## Quick Start

`gnubg` is a native Python extension module that wraps the GNU Backgammon neural-net evaluation engine, so you can call 
the same position-analysis and cube-decision routines that power the GUI from any Python 3.8–3.13 script or application. It’s ideal for batch processing, data-science workflows, or building custom tools and UIs.

### Installation

```bash
pip install gnubg
````

### Getting Started

```python
import gnubg

# Load the engine (weights, bear-off tables, etc. are initialized)
gnubg.initnet()

# Convert a position key (20-char A–Z or 14-char Base64) to a board
board = gnubg.boardfromkey("4HPwATDgc/ABMA")

# Evaluate win/gammon/backgammon probabilities and equity at 4 plies
win, gamm, bg, equity = gnubg.probabilities(board, 4)

print(f"Win: {win:.3f}, Gammon: {gamm:.3f}, Backgammon: {bg:.3f}, Equity: {equity:.3f}")
```

That’s all you need to get up and running! For detailed API docs, advanced build options, and configuration, see the

It provides:

* **Engine initialization & data loading** (neural-net weights, opening-book, bear-off tables)
* **Position classification** (`classify`) & **public-evaluation best move** (`pub_best_move`)
* **Board ↔ ID conversions** (`board_from_position_id`, `board_from_position_key`, `key_of_board`, `position_id`)
* **Dice utilities** (`roll`) & **cube utilities** (`best_move`, `pub_eval_score`)
* **Bear-off tools** (`bearoff_id_2_pos`, `bearoff_probabilities`)
* **Legal-move enumeration** (`moves`) & **probabilistic evaluation** (`probabilities`)
* **Monte-Carlo rollouts** (`rollout`, `cubeful_rollout`)
* **Equity lookup** (`equities.value(xAway, oAway)`)
* **Runtime engine tuning** via the `set` submodule

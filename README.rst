**Features**

- **Engine initialization & data loading** (neural-net weights, opening-book, bear-off tables)
- **Position classification** (``classify``) & **public-evaluation best move** (``pub_best_move``)
- **Board ↔ ID conversions** (``board_from_position_id``, ``board_from_position_key``, ``key_of_board``, ``position_id``)
- **Dice utilities** (``roll``) & **cube utilities** (``best_move``, ``pub_eval_score``)
- **Bear-off tools** (``bearoff_id_2_pos``, ``bearoff_probabilities``)
- **Legal-move enumeration** (``moves``) & **probabilistic evaluation** (``probabilities``)
- **Monte-Carlo rollouts** (``rollout``, ``cubeful_rollout``)
- **Equity lookup** (``equities.value(xAway, oAway)``)
- **Runtime engine tuning** via the ``set`` submodule

Testing
-------

After installation, run basic unit tests with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m unittest discover -s gnubg.tests

AI-Assisted Development
-----------------------

Parts of this project were developed with the assistance of generative AI tools.

Specifically, the following models were used:

- **GPT-4o** (OpenAI ChatGPT)
- **o4-mini-high** (OpenAI ChatGPT)

These models were used to assist with code generation, documentation drafting, and architectural guidance. All outputs were reviewed and curated by a human before inclusion.

.. warning::

   Although human-reviewed, some AI-generated content may contain mistakes, inaccuracies, or outdated practices. Contributors and users should critically assess all code, comments, and documentation. We welcome corrections and improvements via pull requests or issues.
